# git-basics-exercise
Extended exercise covering the basic git workflow, as well as branching and pull requests  
## Instructions:  
This repo contains several text files, however each contains several spelling mistakes! 
In your teams, you should
* nominate one person to fork this repository and add the rest of the group as collaborators
* Each person choose a file to work on and create your own feature branch 
* Correct the spelling errors in your file, stage and commit your changes, and then push to the forked repo
* Submit a pull request into dev. Make sure your pull request goes to the forked repo, not my original
* Once everyone's pull requests have been merged into the development branch, merge the development branch back into the main branch
