# git-basics-exercise
Extended exercise covering the basic git workflow, as well as branching and pull requests  
## Instructions:  
This repo contains several text files, however each contains several spelling mistakes! In your teams, create a shared development branch, and then each person choose a file to work on and create your own feature branch. Correct the spelling errors in your file, stage and commit your changes, and then push to the remote repo and submit a pull request. Once everyone's pull requests have been merged into the development branch, merge the development branch back into the main branch.
